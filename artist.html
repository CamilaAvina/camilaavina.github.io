		<h5>    Hello my name is Camila Avina Garcia. I am 19 years old and currently attending San Jose State University. I am majoring in Digital Media Art.I have learned computer since since the junior year of high school so making this protforlio website was very interesting for me and out of my confort zone. I have tried making websites before but they were not successful. I have also created games. In my portfolio you are going to see assignment that I did for my Art 74 class. They show my improvement in learning digital media art. </h5>
