		<div id="art">
		<p> Hello my name is Camila Avina Garcia. I am 19 years old and currently attending San Jose State University. I am majoring in Digital Media Art.I have learned computer science since junior year of high school so making this protforlio website was very interesting for me and out of my confort zone. I have tried making websites before but they were not successful. I have also created games. In my portfolio you are going to see assignment that I did for my Art 74 class. They show my improvement in learning digital media art. We used Photoshop, Illustrator, Premire, and Processing 
		I love technology and being able to learn all these things that we can do with your computer has help me open up a new world of art in which I can show others what I can do.</p>
