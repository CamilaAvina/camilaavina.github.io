	<!--	<p> Hello my name is Camila Avina Garcia. I am 19 years old and currently attending San Jose State University. I am majoring in Digital Media Art.I have learned computer science since junior year of high school so making this protforlio website was very interesting for me and out of my confort zone. I have tried making websites before but they were not successful. I have also created games. In my portfolio you are going to see assignment that I did for my Art 74 class. They show my improvement in learning digital media art. We used Photoshop, Illustrator, Premire, and Processing
		I love technology and being able to learn all these things that we can do with your computer has help me open up a new world of art in which I can show others what I can do.</p>-->
<p>
	I am currently trying to develop who I am as an artist and what I am interested in. I love how art allows us to express our own self in many forms we did not know about. I like to learn about “what is behind the scenes?”, how sounds can be used in code, and how an animation or game is created. I like to explore the unknown in which it influences me to create work that people will find as the unexpected or think that they know what is going on. I also like to bring awareness to things that happen in our society. Through my work I want people to know who I am and when they see my work they know it is me.  I want people to get memories that they have not seen in a while. I want people to smile as they see my work even if my work has a sober connotation. </p>
	<p>When I first came to learn about Digital Media Art I did not know what to expect and what I want to do with it. All I knew when I applied to be in the Digital Media Art is that I wanted to do something with code. As I kept taking classes and see what Digital Media is about I saw a different view of code and the use of computer science and that is when I knew that I was in the right place.  I was scared at first because I wanted to become a computer science major but I did not want to code that was just to debug or to see simply black and white. I wanted to create and have fun with coding.
</p>
<p>I have always been fascinated when it comes to learning about “what makes something do what it does and how can I do that”. A lot of my works are experimental in trying to figure out if I change something or do something different what reactions will I get. I sometimes feel that when I want to create something I do not know how to start or if I actually put my message across. I feel that as an artist we need to be very cautious on what we want to present and understand the meaning that we want to show. Some people believe that art is just a bunch of colors and shapes but in reality, they are statements.
</p>
<p> For me art has allowed me to show another side of myself to others It helps me not be restricted to what I want to say or what I want to correct. I have learned that art has no limits to what you can do and what you can express. For myself being in Digital Media, I can see what my work can consist of and what I am putting out into the world.  Being able to create a website where I can show my work is so helpful to show what I can do.
