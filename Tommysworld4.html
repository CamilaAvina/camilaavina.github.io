      There is To<span>mm</span>y but no world.


      He can s<span>ee</span> but has no eyes.

      He can f<span>ee</span>l but there is no touch.

      He lives in a r<span>oo</span>m but not in a house.

      He can be fu<span>nn</span>y but has no jokes.

      He is slo<span>pp</span>y and not clean.

      There is a po<span>ss</span>ibility but no chance.
